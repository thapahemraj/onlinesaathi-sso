## 2. Security Features

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
We highly recommend enabling 2FA for extra security:
1. Log in and go to your **Security** settings in the dashboard.
2. Click on **Setup 2FA**.
3. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator).
4. Enter the 6-digit code from the app to verify and enable.

> [!TIP]
> **Backup Codes**: Save your backup codes in a safe place. They are the only way to access your account if you lose your phone.

### Biometric Login
You can sign in using your face, fingerprint, or security key:
1. In the **Security** tab, click **Set up biometrics**.
2. Follow your browser's prompts to register your biometric device.
3. Next time you log in, just click the **Biometric** icon to sign in instantly.
