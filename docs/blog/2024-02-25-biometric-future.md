Passwords are the weakest link in the security chain. They are easy to forget, easy to steal, and hard to manage. But what if you didn't need them at all?

Online Saathi SSO supports **WebAuthn**, the global standard for passwordless authentication. This allows users to sign in using the hardware they already carry—their smartphones and laptops.

### How it Works
When you register a biometric device, your browser generates a unique public-private key pair. The private key never leaves your device's secure enclave (like Touch ID or Face ID), and the public key is stored on our servers.

### Benefits
- **Unphishable**: Since there's no password to steal, phishing attacks become impossible.
- **Frictionless**: Sign in in milliseconds with a simple touch or glance.
- **Secure**: Even if our database is compromised, your actual biometric data is never stored on our servers.
