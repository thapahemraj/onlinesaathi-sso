In today's digital landscape, security is more critical than ever. We've seen countless data breaches and password leaks that compromise user trust. That's why we built **Online Saathi SSO**.

Online Saathi SSO is more than just a login button. It's an enterprise-grade identity provider designed to simplify user access while maximizing security.

### Why SSO?
Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to access multiple applications with one pair of credentials. This reduces password fatigue and decreases the attack surface for hackers.

### Our Vision
We believe that security should be accessible to everyone. By integrating biometric authentication and 2FA as standard features, we are moving towards a passwordless future where your identity is truly yours.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve!
