As businesses grow, their identity needs become more complex. Managing users across multiple departments, subsidiaries, or even different organizations requires a robust architectural approach.

Online Saathi SSO was built from the ground up with **Multi-tenancy** as a core principle. This allows a single deployment of our system to serve multiple independent "Organizations" or "Tenants".

### What is Multi-tenancy?
In an SSO context, multi-tenancy means that each client can have its own set of users, security policies, and branding, while sharing the same underlying infrastructure.

### Key Benefits for Enterprises:
- **Logical Isolation**: Data for one organization is strictly separated from others.
- **Custom Branding**: Each tenant can customize their login screens to match their brand identity.
- **Granular Control**: Manage permissions and features at the organization level.

Whether you're a startup or a global conglomerate, Online Saathi scales with you.
